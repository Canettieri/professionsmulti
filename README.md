## Features

- Individual Titan plugins for every profession available in the current game client.
- A **Master** plugin that summarizes all learned professions in one tooltip.
- Current and maximum profession skill values, active skill bonuses, and gains made during the current session.
- Left-click access to profession windows when supported by the game client.
- Optional profession-combination suggestions in tooltips.
- Reagent totals from bags and the bank, with session gains and losses.
- Per-item visibility controls for reagent plugins.
- A single archaeology-fragments plugin on Retail and Mists of Pandaria Classic.
- Expansion-aware loading, so each game client loads only the profession and reagent data it supports.

## Supported game versions

| Game client | Profession plugins | Reagent sets | Additional plugins |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retail / Midnight | All current professions | Legion, Battle for Azeroth, Shadowlands, and Midnight | Master and Archaeology Fragments |
| Mists of Pandaria Classic | All professions, including First Aid and Archaeology | Mists of Pandaria | Master and Archaeology Fragments |
| Classic Era | All available professions, including First Aid | Classic Era | Master |
| The Burning Crusade Classic | All available professions, including First Aid and Jewelcrafting | The Burning Crusade | Master |

First Aid is intentionally unavailable on Retail. Jewelcrafting is loaded for The Burning Crusade Classic but not for Classic Era.

## How to use

1. Right-click the Titan Panel.
2. Open the **Profession** category to enable profession, Master, or archaeology plugins.
3. Open **Profession [Reagents]** to enable reagent plugins. Category names are translated for supported locales.
4. Right-click an enabled plugin to configure its display options.

Profession plugins can display the icon, maximum skill, simplified bonuses, profession combinations, and session gains. Reagent plugins can display session changes and let you hide individual reagent types. Every plugin menu also includes controls for moving the plugin left or right on its current Titan bar.

For easier identification in the Titan menu, profession plugins are yellow, reagent plugins are orange, and the Master plugin remains red.

## Archaeology Fragments

Add the **Archaeology Fragments** plugin to the Titan bar to track fragments by race. When an artifact is ready to solve, the plugin displays the corresponding race as ready. Its right-click menu can also show races that do not currently have enough fragments.

This plugin is available on Retail and Mists of Pandaria Classic.

## Languages

The addon currently includes translations for:

- English
- Brazilian Portuguese
- German
- Spanish (Spain)
- Spanish (Latin America)
- French

Unsupported locales fall back to English. Reagent item names are obtained directly from the WoW client whenever available.
