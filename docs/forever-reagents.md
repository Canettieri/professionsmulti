# Forever reagent catalogue

Reviewed 2026-10-31 against public Forever beta item data. These are known item
records, not a claim that every item is obtainable in the current client.

## Structure

`Reagents/ClassicData.lua` builds a fresh Classic baseline. `Classic.lua` registers
it unchanged. `Forever.lua` adds the following materials and registers it under
the localized Forever label. Only the Camelot manifest loads `Forever.lua`.
The six plugin IDs and existing `HideItem_<ID>` settings are retained.

| Enchanting | Mote of Magic (247786); Malleable Essence of Nature (274030) |
| Fishing | Whimsyfin (251524); Seasonal Fish Steaks (273295) |

## Scope and validation

The existing Classic material IDs remain in the Forever baseline. An item absent
from an incomplete beta extract is not treated as removed. Names are resolved
from the running client, so name/localization changes do not require new IDs.

This remains a curated material tracker for the existing six categories, not an
inventory of every recipe ingredient. Dyes are included with Tailoring because
they supply cloth crafts; the Mining group includes new bars and mineral-related
crafting reagents. This grouping does not assert a gathering source: for example,
Legionite Bar is an Alchemy transmute. Quest-only items, finished equipment,
camp objects, and the full range of Engineering parts are outside this change.

Automated checks cover catalogue isolation, item-ID uniqueness, preserved Classic
data and settings, TOC routing, registration, bank totals, and session changes
using mocked item APIs. Protected clicks, bank cache behavior and actual item
availability still require an in-game Forever check.
